## What I learned

Working on the Omnifood project provided me with a great learning opportunity, where I was able to apply my knowledge and acquire new skills. Some of the things I learned include:

- How to structure web pages using HTML5 semantic elements and attributes, which makes the code more readable and easier to maintain.
- How to use CSS3 to create visually appealing and responsive web pages, including media queries and grids to ensure the website works on different devices.
- How to add interactivity with JavaScript and jQuery, which made the website more engaging and user-friendly, and how to validate input using JavaScript.
- How to use Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration, which helped me to keep track of changes and work with others more effectively.
- How to implement third-party resources such as Font Awesome and Google Fonts to enhance the website's design and typography.
